# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Description](#description)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Game Controls](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Footer](#footer)

# Description
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

eponymous character through an enclosed maze. 

# Installation
* Install OpenGl on your Ubantu

# Game Controls

* Q - Quit the game
* R – Start a new game (Only when “Game Over” is showing)

# License
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Adding the license to README is a good practice so that people can easily refer to it.

Make sure you have added a LICENSE file in your project folder. **Shortcut:** Click add new file in your root of your repo in GitHub > Set file name to LICENSE > GitHub shows LICENSE templates > Choose the one that best suits your project!

I personally add the name of the license and provide a link to it like below. -->

[The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->
